# Tweaked (Shattered) Pixel Dungeon

Tweaked Pixel Dungeon is a slightly modified version of [Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://shatteredpixel.com/shatteredpd/), an open-source traditional roguelike dungeon crawler with randomized levels and enemies, and hundreds of items to collect and use. SPD is based on the [source code of Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/pixel-dungeon-gradle), by [Watabou](https://www.watabou.ru).

Tweaked Pixel Dungeon currently compiles for Android and Desktop platforms. You can find the releases in [releases](https://github.com/GabrielDTB/tweaked-pixel-dungeon/releases).

There is an official blog for the upstream project at [ShatteredPixel.com](https://www.shatteredpixel.com/blog/). I might write some posts about this project on my blog at [GabrielTB.me/blog](https://www.gabrieltb.me/blog/).

The game also has a translation project hosted on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/shattered-pixel/shattered-pixel-dungeon/).
